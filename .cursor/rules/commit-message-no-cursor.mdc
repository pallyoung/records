# Commit Message Cleanliness

When creating git commits in this repository:

- Do not include "Cursor", "Claude", "OpenAI", or any AI-tool signature in commit titles or bodies.
- Do not add generator trailers such as "Generated with ..." or "Co-authored-by: Cursor ...".
- Keep commit messages focused on the code change intent and outcome.

Examples:

- Good: `feat: persist profile appearance settings`
- Bad: `feat: persist profile appearance settings (generated by Cursor)`
